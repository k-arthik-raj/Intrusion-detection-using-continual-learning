# Intrusion-detection-using-continual-learning
This is an implementation and modification of the paper "Continual Learning for Anomaly based Network Intrusion Detection" by Suresh Kumar et al.

There are two main continual learning concepts at use here - Elastic weight consolidation(EWC) and Gradient episodic memory(GEM).

Library used - PyTorch.
